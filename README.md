This is a project from the 42 curriculum, in which we are supposed to build our own shell.
The subject can be found in the repo.<br>
We implemented an <b>Abstract Syntax Tree</b> to work with the pipes.<br>
Please note that, depending on the version of the readline lib you have on your computer, the line might not display correctly when going through history. <br><br>
PS: If you're wondering about the turtles, the name of our team was Ninja Turtles, so there you go!
