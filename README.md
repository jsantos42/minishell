![screenshot](screenshot.png)

This is a project from the 42 curriculum, in which we are supposed to build our own shell.
The subject can be found in the repo.<br>
We implemented an <b>Abstract Syntax Tree</b> to work with the pipes.<br><br>

## RUN
To run on Mac, you can use either the Makefile or the Cmake.<br>
To run on Linux, use the Cmake (the Makefile needs some tweaks).

## DEPENDENCIES
Install the readline package.
On Debian based platforms: ```sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev```<br>
Please note that, depending on the version of the readline lib you have on your computer, the line might not display correctly when going through history.

PS: If you're wondering about the turtles, the name of our team was Ninja Turtles, so there you go!
