This is a project from the 42 curriculum, in which we are supposed to build our own shell.
The subject can be found in the repo.<br>
We implemented an Abstract Syntax Tree to work with the pipes.<br>
Please note that, depending on the version of the readline lib you have on your computer, the line might not display correctly when going through history. <br>
Enjoy!
